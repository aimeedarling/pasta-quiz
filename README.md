# Pasta Trivia

## Description

I love pasta! I love pub trivia!

So, I made a little pasta trivia game. This project showcases my slowly emerging  JavaScript skills. I've included a timer that counts down during game play, time is deducted when incorrect answers are selected. I've included an input form for initials, and a scoreboard with persistent scores stored and fetched from local storage.

I've tried to write it dynamically so when I think of more questions I can easily add them to the script file.
