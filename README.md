# Pasta Trivia

## Description

I love pasta! I love pub trivia!

So, I made a little pasta trivia game. This project showcases my slowly emerging  JavaScript skills. I've included a timer that counts down during game play, time is deducted when incorrect answers are selected. I've included an input form for initials, and a scoreboard with persistent scores stored and fetched from local storage.

I've tried to write it dynamically so when I think of more questions I can easily add them to the script file.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
